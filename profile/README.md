# The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS)

This is the GitHub organisation for the LoVoCCS collaboration, where we hope to make our sample, analyses, and results easily available and version controlled. We will also attempt to provide access to raw data, but that is most likely **not feasible** due to the size and number of files.

## Main project overview

We are a collaboration studying a volume-limited set of 147 massive, local, galaxy clusters, selected from the Meta-Catalog of X-Ray Detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) to be complete to $L^{0.1−2.4\rm{keV}}_{\rm{X}, 500} > 10^{44} \rm{erg} \rm{s}^{−1}$ (where $L\_{\rm{X}}$ is the X-ray luminosity of the cluster). Our systems are being observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Victor M. Blanco telescope in Chile, and the Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) on the Subaru telescope in Hawaii, with the goal of producing 2D weak-lensing mass maps.

The scale of this 2D weak-lensing study is unprecendented, both in terms of the number of weak-lensing maps being produced and the fact that we are studying local systems ($0.03 < z < 0.12$), for which it is much more difficult to measure the shears of background galaxies required for weak-lensing. We are also acting as a precursor survey to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will be performed using the new Vera Rubin Observatory over the course of the next decade. We are helping to test the pipelines that will be used to analyse their data, and any analyses we develop for LoVoCCS will be applicable to LSST cluster studies.
